Welcome to Python Basics, taught by  Paul Resnick, Steve Oney, and Jaclyn Cohen!

Oh, they have a cool textbook - login only through the coursea. 
I love more and more the University of Michigan.

Introduction to the week 2:

Strings and lists:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics/supplement/LpS8g/lists

In two words workin with some operators for arrays and tuples.

Slice operators:

Count and index:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics/lecture/adUHy/count-and-index

Splits and joins:
Split create an array out of string.

Loops:

After the optional reading what I'll do today start the week 3:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics/ungradedLti/bHcnM/single-sign-on-interactive-textbook-and-practice-opportunities
You know - I should keep on practice with it, I'll be great there are no doubghts about
that - I can be great in learning python, data science ... And it could bring the company
a lot of value, simple steps but I should move forward one by one - it's really interesting.

Nested conditionals:

The Accumulator Pattern with Conditionals and Accumulating a Maximum Value:

Cloning lists:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-basics/lecture/o7jDA/cloning-lists
we can clone the list using slice x = a[:] - just wow also avaliable with copy() and others

Mutating lists:

Accumulating Lists and Strings:

Accumulator Pattern strategies - kind of cool thing to figure out pattern based on words in task:

Don't mutate the list you are iterating through:
